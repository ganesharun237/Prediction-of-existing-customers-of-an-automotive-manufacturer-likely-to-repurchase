# Prediction-of-existing-customers-of-an-automotive-manufacturer-likely-to-repurchase
Predict  which of the existing customers of an automotive manufacturer company would likely repurchase using classification modelling algorithms on a product purchase dataset. All customers have already purchased at least one vehicle. Class imbalance was observed in the target variable and hence smote technique was used to rectify class imbalance to improve accuracy of results. Logistic regression and GBM classification models were used.  Recall parameter was considered for model evaluation and the GBM outperformed the logistic regression in that case.. The insights, results, exploratory data analysis, Data Visualisation obtained from this project was wrapped into a report (Report.pdf).
